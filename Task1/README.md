# Task1

Create a C# program that prompts the user for three names of people and stores them in an array of Person-type objects. To do this, first create a Person class that has a Name property of type string, a constructor that receives the name as a parameter, a destructor that assigns the name to empty and overwrites the ToString () method.
 End the program by reading the people and executing the ToString () method on screen.
